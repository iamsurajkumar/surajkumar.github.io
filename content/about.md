## About Me,  *Professional Summary*

Hello! I'm an *Engineer-turned-Economist* with a passion for macroeconomics. After graduating from IIT Delhi in 2014 with a B.Tech in Civil Engineering, I developed a strong interest in economics, which led me to pursue a Master's degree at the Delhi School of Economics.

I began my career as a Model Validator at Credit Suisse, validating macro models predicting revenue in the EMEA region. Later, at American Express, I built machine learning models to predict customer credit card spending. My desire to focus on macroeconomics brought me to Goldman Sachs as an Economics Analyst, where I covered India's macroeconomic developments, tracked key economic indicators, wrote thematic reports, and addressed client queries.

In September 2022, I joined the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) at the Reserve Bank of India as a Research Associate. Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at Boston College, aiming to deepen my understanding and contribute to the field.

Thank you for visiting my blog! Here, I share my thoughts on market research, academic pursuits, and more. Feel free to explore and connect with me.
