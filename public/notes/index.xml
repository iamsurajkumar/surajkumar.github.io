      <description>Introduction Let me think, how do I want to begin journy of writing my own independent research notes. I always wanted to start with after leaving Goldman Sachs, but some or the other way I delayed it.
Now by chance discovey of it, I have kind of figured it out how to do it. But yeah, I would like to give the credit for this to Prof. Pascal Michaillat who inspired me to use Hugo to for this purpose.</description>
