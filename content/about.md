I am an **Engineer-turned-Economist**.

I stumbled upon Economics after having graduated from IIT Delhi. I liked the subject so much that I taught myself the basics and enrolled in a master's program at the Delhi School of Economics.

Thereafter, I went on to work in validating macro models at Credit Suisse, building machine learning models to predict credit card spending at American Express, and analysing and forecasting India's macroeconomic data such as GDP, Inflation, and Balance of Payments at Goldman Sachs.

Currently, I am working as a Research Associate at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning at the Reserve Bank of India.
