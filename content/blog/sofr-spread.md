Professor recommended another measure of looking at the stress that instead of looking at spread between IOR and SOFR rate instead we look at the timings of the major payments to the bank. That is suppose if the major payment to the bank happens early afternoon by a major transaction then that bank is fine but suppose if the payment happens after say late afternoon or 100 minutes past that and the bank may start need to worry about how it will finance its payments to its border wall.


This signal is better than just simply looking at the spread between SOFR and IOR rate. Because that spread can jump very quickly. As happened in September 2019, (I need to do more research on this).

So now the Federal Reserve is not trying to like estimate the minimum reserve balances and trying to come into that it's like it wants to leave ample buffer between the required reserve balances.

The author or the professor made a good point that the federal reserve on its balance sheet on the liability side has two main component. The first one is reserve balances and the second one is overnight repo facilities which is used by money market funds to park their excess reserves to the Fed. Now over the past year or so since the beginning of the quantitative tightening the Fed has seen that side of the liabilities that is overnight repo facility coming down. Now it's pretty much near to zero. So any additional quantitative tightening has to come from the side of now reserve balances.

He also mentioned something with regard to Treasury General Account and how that affects reserve balances and something about debt and how debt is linked to the Treasury General Account. I need to do a research on it.


He gave a very good example that repos and treasury bills move together because treasury bills are also a very safe liquid asset and the bank has basically to make the choice between how much to keep as reserve balance is at the Fed, how much to invest in treasury bills or how much to spend in overnight repo. Now as the treasury bills are becoming more and more abundant to make the market clear, the interest rate on treasury bill rises. Now since the interest rate on reserve balance is fixed by the bank by the federal reserve, so the only rate which can move is the repose rate and that so move intended with the treasury bills.

He also mentioned that nowadays or say a very interesting thing about Treasury bills is that since the counterparty is Treasury, so the bank don't have the luxury to delay the payments. Like they have to pay at upfront, they have to pay at the beginning of the day, the amount of Treasury security that they want in the auction the previous day. And now if there are more and more Treasury bills issued, then that's going to drive up the pressure on the NEPO market.


Q - What is the difference between the repo market and the Fed fund trade market? Aren't they the same?

N - Well to really write this article well I need to understand the dynamics of the Fed balance sheet. So I have to look at the major assets and liabilities of the Fed and note that what is happening, what is coming down, what is increasing in my note.

Q - Perhaps read that paper by Stephen Miran with Noreal Robani about what's happening, how the Treasury Bill issuance policy is like a stealth quantitative, easy to stimulate the economy.


The Treasury Department is not really conducting a monetary policy, it's just trying to finance the US government debt at the lowest possible interest rate.


He said about two mechanics which affects the SOFR rate. The first one is the overall supply of treasury bills. So the more the supply the higher will be the rate. The second is that on the day of issuance of treasury security the coupon payments affects the SOFR rate. But that is just on the days when the coupon is paid. But on a general day to day basis it's more driven by the treasury bills.

It's like you mentioned that the Federal Reserve uses this overnight reserve facility as a kind of placeholder for the rates at the lower end. So previously the overnight report rate was higher than the Fed Fund rate, higher than the high of the Fed Fund target band, but now it's just about 5 basis points above the low point of the Fed Fund target. So the Fed is kind of okay in letting or draining this facility.

Data - I need to have the data on the interest rates of all the facilities of the Fed to be able to make this point. Yeah. Thank you.

Q - He said that the government could do monetary policy stimulus by increasing the supply of bills or reducing the supply of bills. If they are going the other way, I don't got this fact.


This was to answer the jacks question on why the treasury is borrowing in the short term when we have an inverted yield curve with very low 30 year yields.

So the Treasury Department is not like a price taking issuer, like a corporation, but like a price settling issuer. So it can drive the price down or it can stop selling the long term securities to raise the price.


Further Reading - People mentioned of Jeremy Stein at Harvard with Sam Hanson, Robin Greenwood and Adi Sundaram regarding that the Treasury Department is issuing too few Treasury Billions.

Treasury bills issuance a chart will help me understand the issue better. 

Jack argued that they issued less Treasury securities because they estimated that if they issue 100 billion perth of more Treasury securities that's gonna push up rates in the market so that's why they issued less Treasury securities and more of Treasury bills. But the author Daniel Duffy was not on top of it, he said that's simply because of cash management reasons.

The professor mentioned that the old view of the government was that if we keep our average maturity high then we are kind of reducing the risk of a roll over of the treasury debt. So in a sense that led to them having huge amount of treasuries and very low treasure bills. But now that view is changing in the last four to five years because they calculated that the risk of that roll over event not happening is quite low and there is a lot of demand in the market for treasuries as seen by the reparates. Repeated hit on Debt cap account at the Fed, lot of bills. 

Flexible short term securities. 

Loanable funds model: 

The government sort of crowding out the private market debt by issuing so much government debt. . Thank you.

Inflation is is a good leisure activity

Normal GDP growth higher than debt growth level. 

What is the level at which we cannot return? How are you thinking about it? Italy and Japan are more teneous

in some mid-march 2020, the treasury market is so high thant the repo market broke down. 

NOt fair to future generations to load them with so much debt. When it breaks, 

What will you be looking

late October 2023,


Term premium - Negative in covid but very high right now. If the Government issues more of such than it can even spread to 150 or 160 basis points also. So can we say that the term premium is a sort of indication of the stress in the debt market?

He also made a very interesting point like Treasury securities are a kind of only game in town like they are the only sort of safe effort which is demanded by these pension funds or these asset managers to manage their risk. Like would you buy a European countries debt or a Japanese debt or Chinese debt?

He said that everyone says that the dollar is a safe heaven but where do you park the dollar? You can't have it in a deposit account or do nothing.

He also mentioned about central clearing of treasury securities, how that it's fight of being having some extra fees is going to make the treasury market more versatile. I really don't, didn't get that fact.


Read - His recent paper with Zachary Wang, Harry Cooperman, and Yiling Yang. Thank you.

LIBOR was manipulated, its not easy to manipulate SOFR. Supply credit lines to banks. 

Largest safest bank have no difficult in getting credit lines as they get the cheap credit lines from the these customers as well.
