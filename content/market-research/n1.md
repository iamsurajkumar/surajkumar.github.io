### Data Points

Last week, the US growth numbers came in below expectation at 1.1% qoq sa ann. compared to the consensus expectation of 2% qoq sa ann. and slower than the Q4 growth at 2.6% qoq sa ann. It is primarily driven by liquidation of business investories ahead of expected weaker demand later this year. On the other hand, consumer spending picked up driven by increased spending in the durable sector of the economy such as motor vehicles.
