Summary: "This paper builds a model of hypothesis testing with p-hacking and gives critical values that correct the inflated type 1 error rate caused by p-hacking. As a rule of thumb, robust critical values are classical critical values with one-fifth the significance level."

##### Abstract

Despite its prevalence, p-hacking is not taken into account in classical hypothesis testing theory. To address this problem, we build a model of p-hacking and use it to construct critical values such that, if these values are used to determine significance, and if scientists adjust their p-hacking behavior to these new significance standards, then significant results occur with the desired frequency. Because such robust critical values allow for p-hacking, they are larger than classical critical values. For instance, in the model calibrated to the social and medical sciences, the robust critical value for any test statistic is the classical critical value for the same test statistic with one fifth of the significance level.
