## Introduction

Welcome to my journey of writing independent research notes! I always wanted to start this after leaving Goldman Sachs, but somehow, I kept delaying it.

Now, I've finally figured out how to do it. I owe a big thanks to [Prof. Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) for inspiring me to use *Hugo* for this purpose.

Here are my main intentions for starting this blog:

- To help us understand global financial markets by writing weekly/monthly macro reviews, connecting market developments with the economy.
- To discuss interesting research papers related to the Indian Economy, Macroeconomy, Finance, Machine Learning, and Markets, or summarize existing market research.
- To share my independent research.

Let's get started!
