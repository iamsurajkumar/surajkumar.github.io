## Introduction

Let me think, how do I want to begin journey of writing my own independent research notes. I always wanted to start it after leaving Goldman Sachs, but some or the other way I delayed it. 

Now by chance, I have kind of figured it out how to do it. But yeah, I would like to give the credit for this to [Prof. Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) who inspired me to use *Hugo* to for this purpose.

Now let me reflect on the intentions behind starting something like this, I mainly intend to cover the following items

- To help us in understanding what is happening in global financial markets by writing a kind of weekly/monthly macro reviews where I would like to connect the developments in markets with economy. 
- To discuss interesting research papers related to Indian Economy, Macroeconomy, Finance, Machine Learning and Markets. Or summarize existing good markets research
- My independent research

Let's get started!
