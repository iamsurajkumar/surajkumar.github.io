I describe myself as an **Engineer-turned-Economist**. Even after working in the field of Economics for the past 5 years, I still consider myself an Engineer at heart. By chance, I stumbled upon Economics after graduating from IIT Delhi in 2014. I developed a strong interest in the subject and decided to pursue formal studies in economics. As a result, I enrolled in a Master's program at the Delhi School of Economics.

Due to some financial constraints at that time, I made the decision to take up a corporate job. Thus, I started working as an analyst at Credit Suisse, where I validated macro models predicting revenue from a business segment in the EMEA region. After some time, I transitioned to American Express, where I worked on building machine learning models using XGBoost to predict prospective customer credit card spending. However, pure machine learning did not fulfill my passion for macroeconomics, and I began searching for other opportunities. Fortunately, I was offered a job as a research analyst at Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, where I focused on covering India's macroeconomic developments.

My work at Goldman Sachs provided crucial experience and allowed me to gain insight into the role of a market economist. Specifically, my responsibilities included:

1. Tracking the Indian Economy: Monitoring GDP, inflation, RBI policy meetings, and trade and fiscal data.
2. Writing thematic pieces on India's economy, such as analyzing the drivers of India's exports, exploring long-term potential growth for India, and examining the determinants of RBI policy rates.
3. Addressing client queries.

Working at Goldman Sachs was undeniably fascinating and challenging, and I had the privilege of having excellent mentors. However, my desire to pursue a PhD remained strong. In September 2022, I joined as a Research Associate at the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) at the Reserve Bank of India, where I am currently engaged.
